# Storacha Onchain Payments (Solana)

**Storacha Onchain Payments** is a proof-of-concept system enabling **per-upload, pay-as-you-go decentralized storage payments on Solana**.
Users pay with **native SOL**, while a fiat-subscribed reseller account underwrites the storage service.
This monorepo contains the **Solana Payment Program**, **Backend API**, and **TypeScript SDK**.

## Features

- **Onchain Payments** – Pay storage fees directly with SOL.
- **No Credit Cards** – Pure crypto-native flow.
- **Escrow-based Rewards** – Funds released linearly per block to service providers.
- **Backend API with UCAN Delegation** – Secure storage delegation via UCAN tokens.
- **TypeScript SDK** – Easily integrate with dapps (supports Solana Mobile dapp publishing).
- **Extensible** – Designed for multi-chain support (Phase 2).

## Monorepo Structure

```
solana-programs/  # Solana payment contract (Anchor framework)
backend/          # Node.js backend API with UCAN storage delegation
sdk/              # TypeScript SDK (@storacha/sol-sdk)
```

## Quick Start

### **1. Prerequisites**

- [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Solana CLI](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation)
- [Anchor Framework](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)
- [Node.js >= 20](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- (Optional) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for test validators

  - **IMPORTANT:** Install using the Anza installer to avoid SSL/archive issues:

    ```bash
    sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"
    ```

* [Anchor Framework](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)
* [Node.js >= 20](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
* (Optional) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for test validators

### **2. Clone & Install Dependencies**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seetadev/storacha-solana-sdk.git
cd storacha-solana-sdk
pnpm install
```

### **3. Solana Localnet Setup**

```bash
cd solana-programs

# If you're on macOS, you may need to remove old ledgers (fixes macOS ._genesis.bin errors)
rm -rf test-ledger

# Prevent macOS from creating ._ resource forks during extraction
export COPYFILE_DISABLE=true

# Start local validator
solana-test-validator
```

### **4. Build & Deploy the Solana Program**

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd solana-programs
anchor build
anchor deploy
```

### **5. Airdrop Some SOL**

```bash
solana airdrop 2
```

If it fails initially due to rate limits, retry after a few seconds. I'd recommend you get test with low amounts for now, say, 0.5 SOL as the maximun your can request for is 5.

Check if you've started the test-validator before requesting for the airdrop

### **6. Backend Server**

```bash
cd backend
pnpm dev
```

### **7. SDK**

```bash
cd sdk
pnpm build
```

## Testing

### **Anchor Program Tests**

```bash
cd solana-programs
anchor test
```

### **Backend Tests**

```bash
cd backend
pnpm test
```

### **SDK Tests**

```bash
cd sdk
pnpm test
```

## **Backend Database Migration Workflow**

1. **Navigate to the Backend directory**

   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```

2. **Generate migration files**
   Creates a migration script based on the differences between the current database schema and your updated schema definitions.

   ```bash
   pnpm migrations-generate
   ```

3. **Apply migrations to the database**
   Runs the generated migration scripts to update the database schema.

   ```bash
   pnpm migrations-apply
   ```

## Testing and actually using the program

Install a Solana wallet like Phantom wallet in your browser. Go your settings and click on "Developer Settings".

Toggle the testnet option, and then go to [Solana Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/) to airdrop SOL into your wallet. You'll need to copy your testnet address for this.

When you're done, clone this [sample repo](https://github.com/kaf-lamed-beyt/sto-sol) to basically test that you can make a deposit. The backend server has to be running locally for this to work. Please ensure that is right.

You can also the test the sdk locally without publishing it by cloning this [react-example](https://github.com/HarshS1611/Storacha-Solana-SDK-Example) to test the desposit. Follow the setup instructions to link the sdk with the project.

## Side Notes

- **Program IDL:**
  After building, the generated IDL will be in `target/idl/solana_programs.json`.

- **Program ID:**
  The Solana program ID is fixed to a pre-generated keypair located at `solana-programs/target/deploy/solana_programs-keypair.json`.
  You don’t need to manually generate new ones unless you're deploying to devnet/mainnet.

- **Copyfile Disable on MacOS:**
  Always set `export COPYFILE_DISABLE=true` before running `solana-test-validator` to prevent `.DS_Store`/`._genesis.bin` issues.

- **Solana CLI Versioning:**
  Use the **Anza installer** as shown above to avoid inconsistent binary issues.

- **Anchor Versioning:**
  Ensure your `anchor-lang` version in Cargo.toml matches the Anchor CLI version.
  You might need to tweak `[features]` in Anchor.toml if the need arises
