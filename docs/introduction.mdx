# Welcome to Keep

Keep enables **per-upload, pay-as-you-go decentralized storage payments on Solana**, with plans to expand to Filecoin, Base (Ethereum L2), and other chains.

## What is Keep?

Keep allows users to pay for decentralized storage directly with SOL, eliminating the need for credit cards or subscriptions. Integrated with Storacha (formerly web3.storage), Keep provides a crypto-native storage solution.

We're actively working on multi-chain support to enable payments with FIL, ETH, and other cryptocurrencies, making decentralized storage accessible across different blockchain ecosystems.
