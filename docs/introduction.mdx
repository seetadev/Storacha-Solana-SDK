# Welcome to toju

*tọjú* (pronounced "toh-joo") means "to keep" in [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language), a language spoken by over 40 million people in West Africa.

We built toju to bridge the gap between crypto users and decentralized storage on Filecoin via [Storacha](https://storacha.network). No credit cards, no subscriptions—just pay for IPFS storage with SOL (and soon FIL, USDFC, and other crypto).

## What this is.

toju is a **payment bridge** that enables crypto-native users to pay for decentralized storage on IPFS via Storacha, without the traditional hassle of credit cards or subscriptions.

We're not a storage layer &mdash; we're the onramp that lets you pay for Storacha storage using your crypto wallet. Starting with Solana, we're expanding to support FIL, USDFC (the native Filecoin stablecoin), and other chains to onboard more users into the Filecoin/Protocol Labs ecosystem.
