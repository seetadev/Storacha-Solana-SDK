# Welcome to toju

*tọjú* (pronounced "toh-joo") means "to keep" in [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language), a language spoken by over 50 million people in West Africa.

We built toju to bridge the gap between crypto users and decentralized storage on Filecoin via [Storacha](https://storacha.network). No credit cards, no subscriptions &mdash; just pay for IPFS storage with SOL or USDFC.

## What this is.

toju is a **payment bridge** that enables crypto-native users to pay for decentralized storage on IPFS via Storacha, without the traditional hassle of credit cards or subscriptions.

We're not a storage layer &mdash; we're the onramp that lets you pay for Storacha storage using your crypto wallet. We currently support **Solana (SOL)** and **Filecoin (USDFC)**, with more chains coming soon.
