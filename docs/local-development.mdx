<Info>
  This guide is for contributors who want to run the project locally for development. If you just want to use the sdk, check out the [Quickstart](/quickstart) guide.
</Info>


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Solana CLI](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation) (use Anza installer)
- [Anchor Framework](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)
- [Node.js >= 20](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

<Warning>
  Install Solana CLI using the Anza installer to avoid SSL/archive issues:
  ```bash
  sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"
  ```
</Warning>

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seetadev/Storacha-Solana-SDK.git
cd Storacha-Solana-SDK
pnpm install
```

## Start Local Validator

```bash
cd solana-programs

# On macOS, prevent resource fork issues
export COPYFILE_DISABLE=true

# Remove old ledgers if needed
rm -rf test-ledger

# Start validator
solana-test-validator
```

## Deploy Solana Program

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd solana-programs
anchor build
anchor deploy
```

## Configure Server

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env

# Generate admin keypair
./scripts/generate-admin-key.sh
```

Edit `.env` and fill in:
- Resend API key ([get one here](https://resend.com))
- Database credentials
- Storacha keys
- Admin keypair from script output

## Start Development Servers

<CodeGroup>

```bash Server
cd server
pnpm dev
```

```bash UI
cd ui
pnpm dev
```

```bash SDK
cd sdk
pnpm build
```

</CodeGroup>

## Get Test SOL

```bash
solana airdrop 2
```

<Info>
  If the airdrop fails due to rate limits, wait a few seconds and retry.
</Info>

## Verify Installation

1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Connect your wallet (make sure it's on testnet)
3. Try uploading a test file

<Check>
  If you can successfully upload a file, your local setup is complete!
</Check>

## Troubleshooting
